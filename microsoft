About the team:
I am working as an individual contributor for this hackathon as team Oreo since my teammate felt sick. 

About the problem and Current updates:
The problem I have understood so far looks like a basic classification and regression problem over text data.
At this stage, I have the training and test data available with me. I am working over converting this data into better structure based on the 
'\t' and problem-specified delimiters. Once this is done and I can read my data properly, I Would be ready to set go and apply some learning algorithms
and try evaluation procedure. The idea would be to run a classifier, try to feed in some training data, engineer features such as [title, summary] and set the topic as the target.
Hopefully, we will get some good accuracy. Similarly, I will be trying to perform a regression task. Stay tuned for more updates as we bring WORDS INTO ACTION.


Tools:
I plan to use tools for data science adn Machine learning: IPython notebook, Graphlab create and program in Python. These tools can be very helpful
in doing evaluation and visualisation.

Thanks,
Rahul
